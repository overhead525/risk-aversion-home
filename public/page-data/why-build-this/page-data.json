Look at all these dueche bags out\nthere dressed in those stupid red suits, wouldn't you feel satisfied by actually\nkilling one or all of them?  I would, I personally find great personal\nsatisfaction in killing of as many bastards in thpse suits as possible, and\nthat's why I'm here...  Share some personal experiences in killing of the Santa\nClauses.\n\n  Stretch a piano cord across the road between two telephone poles so when the\nbastard (Saint Nick) come flying by on a sleigh or a fire engine his head will\ncome right off.\n\n  Obtain a hand held land to air heat seaking missile, when he comes by, nuke\nthe fuck to kingdome-come!\n\n  Point a .45 caliber starting pistol at his head when he's in the mall and\nthreaten to give him a massive vasectomy.  Then fire and watch the fat shit have\na heart attack!\n\n  Put a gas burner on the bottom of your fire place.\n\n  Put a shot gun on the bottom of your fire place attacked to the handle on the\nflew.\n\n  Put a lot of oil on your roof and watch the fat shit try and land!\n\n  Kick him off his sleigh in mid air.\n\n  Put an altimeter bomb in his sleigh, so when he goes high enough it's bye-bye\nfor the fuck.\n\n  Loosen the blades on his sleigh when he trys to land, it's Santa all over the\nplace.\n\n  Sacrifice his reign deer.\n\n  Bolt a rope to the roof of your house, and tie the other end to his sleigh.\nIt's one fucked up sleigh when he gets moving.\n\n  Run over him with a car when he lands on the road.\n\n  Fire a fat-seeking missile at his sleigh in mid air.\n\n  Have him arrested at night time for breaking and entering into your house.\n\n  When he comes down the chiminey, smash him across the face with a metal base\nball bat.\n\n  Fire a flame thrower at him when he's a-comin down the chimney.\n\n\n\n\nJust remember when the old bastard comes---\n\n  \"You better not pout, you better not cry, Santa Claus is coming to town.\"\n\n  ---little does the fat shit know if he comes near my town he's gonna have the\n     worst night of his life, not to mention the last.\n\n\n\n\t\t     When all else fails, kill the fuck....\n\n\t\t\t\t      >Outland>\n\n\n///\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\n | Call the rest of the best--- \t\t\t\t\t    |\n | Milliways  10Meg/BBS/AE/Catfur............................(609)/921-1994 |\n | Metalland I\t10Meg/BBS/AE/Catfur..........................(503)/538-0761 |\n | Metal Works AE  Pw:Rape...................................(313)/663-8103 |\n | Metal AE  Pw:Kill.........................................(201)/879-6668 |\n | Mordar AE  10Meg  Pw:Zandar...............................(201)/528-6467 |\n\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\////\\\\\\\\///\nCall The Works BBS - 1600+ Textfiles! - [914]/238-8195 - 300/1200 - Always Open\n\n\nX-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-X\n\n Another file downloaded from:                               NIRVANAnet(tm)\n\n & the Temple of the Screaming Electron   Jeff Hunter          510-935-5845\n Rat Head                                 Ratsnatcher          510-524-3649\n Burn This Flag                           Zardoz               408-363-9766\n realitycheck                             Poindexter Fortran   415-567-7043\n Lies Unlimited                           Mick Freen           415-583-4102\n\n   Specializing in conversations, obscure information, high explosives,\n       arcane knowledge, political extremism, diversive sexuality,\n       insane speculation, and wild rumours.
